# Simulation_Bank_Queues
This project is devoted to the application of queuing theory using two models involving different numbers of tellers. Through simulation, we were able to understand and determine how to model a multiple-server queue. A multiple-server queue made it possible to decrease waiting times and hence the average number of people standing in line. By decreasing waiting times, we were able to maximize the operational effectiveness and efficiency of the bank.
